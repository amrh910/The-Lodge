My name is Drake. I am a 31-year-old Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor, and entrepreneur.
I want to create a music event and host it at Carnegie Hall. I am going to log on to the website and create a post
detailing my event. Hopefully lots of people will see my post and come to my event.

My name is Julia. I am a music and dance enthusiast. I have a few friends coming to visit me in the city and we want
to have a fun night out. I log onto the website and look for interesting events in my area. I see a cool concert I
want to attend at Carnegie Hall. I RSVP saying I am attending the event.
